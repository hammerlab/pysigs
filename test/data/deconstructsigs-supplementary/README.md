> Additional file 3: Table S1. The mutational signature contribution to each TCGA tumor sample studied as determined by deconstructSigs and WTSI Mutational Signature Framework. Signatures used as input to deconstructSigs were limited to those extracted using the WTSI Mutational Signature Framework approach. (TXT 464 kb)

> Additional file 6: Table S2. The mutational signature contribution to each TCGA tumor sample studied as determined by deconstructSigs and WTSI Mutational Signature Framework. The full published set of mutational signatures [4] was allowed to be used as input to deconstructSigs. Tumor types considered were limited to those where only unambiguous signatures could be extracted using the WTSI Mutational Signature Framework to allow for direct comparison with the input reference signature set.
